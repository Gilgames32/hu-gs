**HU-GS Universe - Ghost Screens**

## Controls, rules
- Move sideways with A and D, jump with W or Space.
- Use your mouse to move windows. Windows put next to each other can be walked trough. (They do not necessarily have to be pixel perfectly next to each other, works even if they are about less than 10 pixels away.)
- Overlapping windows will show a cyan rectangle. Clicking it will move the window to the nearest position where it does not overlap.
- The game will pause when there are windows overlapping.
- You cannot move windows if an entity is in multiple windows at the same time.

Have fun playing!

Special thanks to **Acrazit**, for level ideas, the robot and the platform sprites, and the icon!

This was a school project in Java, and I had to use Swing. It should explain the terrible performance and UI, since it was not designed to be written games in. But many of us did anyway.
